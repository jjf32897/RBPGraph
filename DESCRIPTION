Title: Estimates RBP Co-Binding from eCLIP Data Using Partial Correlation Networks
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Jo-Jo Feng
Maintainer: The package maintainer <jo-jo.feng@yale.edu>
Description: This package provides functions to convert from eCLIP narrowPeak files to matrices that can be used to estimate partial correlation coefficients between RBPs to identify potential co-binding partners. Together, these functions compose a streamlined workflow for generating networks direclty from eCLIP peak files. We also provide a flexible and easy-to-use framework to view and analyze the graphs.
