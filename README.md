# RBPGraph
An R package to estimate RBP co-binding networks from eCLIP narrowPeak data.
Provides a series of functions to automate the process from eCLIP files -> bedGraphs -> bigWigs -> RBP-bin observation matrix -> graphs.

Depends on the glasso, qgraph, and huge packages.

Please refer to the PDF manual in this repository for more details.

Thank you to Jing Zhang, Mark Gerstein, Jason Liu, and Donghoon Lee for their help on this project!
